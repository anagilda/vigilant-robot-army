Tiny robots I created with Python - web scrapers, bots...

### Product images

Scrapes a store website to find all images of a product in a slideshow and download them, with numbered file names.

### Language options
Scrapes a website to find options available for a given `<select>` element, even if they are added by javascript and take a while to load. If the options change, an email is sent to a given email address.

In the example, it looks for language options at Khan Academy.

### Phone details
Scrapes the gsmarena website for brands and phone details urls. Prints all info to screen and saves a JSON file with each phone model and details url.

This functionality is further explored in my [The Mobile Store - REST API](https://github.com/anagilda/the-mobile-store-REST-API) project.
